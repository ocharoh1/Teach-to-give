                <p style="color: white; font-weight: lighter;">
                    I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best – and most grueling – time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            <p style="margin-right: 30px; margin-left: 30px; color: black;"> Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; color: white;">The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress, which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
